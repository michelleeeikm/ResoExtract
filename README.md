# ResoExtract - EXE Resource Extractor

ResoExtract is a simple tool designed to extract embedded resources from Windows executable files (.exe). With an intuitive GUI, you can easily view and manage resources like icons, images, and strings.

## Features

- **View Resources**: Explore resources embedded in executable files, including:
  - Icons
  - Images (BMP, PNG, JPG)
  - Audio files
  - Strings
  - XML and other data files
- **Tree View**: Organized display of resources with type and size details.
- **Drag-and-Drop Support**: Quickly load executable files by dragging them into the interface.
- **Output Folder Selection**: Choose where extracted resources will be saved.
- **Selective or Full Extraction**: Extract specific resources or all resources at once (under development).

## How It Works

1. Select an executable file via the **Browse** button or drag and drop it into the application.
2. View the file's resources in the tree view, categorized by type.
3. Choose specific resources or all resources for extraction (coming soon).

## Application Layout

- **File Selection**: Allows you to load the executable file.
- **Output Folder**: Select the directory where extracted resources will be saved.
- **Tree View**: Displays resources with their type and size.
- **Control Buttons**:
  - `Extract Selected`: Extract only the selected resource.
  - `Extract All`: Extract all available resources (under development).

## Limitations

- Resource extraction is a work-in-progress feature.
- Supports standard Windows executable formats.
- May not work on executables with advanced resource packing or encryption.
